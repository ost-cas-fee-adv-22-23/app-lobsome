# 🐼 Mumble App by Team LOBSOME 🐼



In this project, we implemented the [Mumble Design System](https://smartive-education.github.io/design-system-component-library-lobsome/?path=/story/welcome-hello--page/). 
Throughout the project, we worked collaboratively to achieve a clean, fast and maintainable code. 
By the end of the project, we hope to have gained a deeper understanding of the architecture around [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), 
as well as developed important skills that will serve us well in future academic and professional pursuits.

We look forward to sharing our findings and experiences with our classmates and instructors, 
and to learning from their projects as well. Thanks for checking out our Project!

### Installing

Step-by-step instructions on how to set up the project.

To use this library you need to add an .npmrc file with an auth-token

After successful installation you can use one of the following commands:

```
npm run dev - Runs next dev to start Next.js in development mode
```
```
npm run build - Runs next build to build the application for production usage
```
```
npm run start - Runs next start to start a Next.js production server
```
```
npm run lint - Runs next lint to set up Next.js' built-in ESLint configuration
```
