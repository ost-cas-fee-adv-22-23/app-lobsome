# üêº Mumble App by Team LOBSOME üêº



In this project, we implemented the [Mumble Design System](https://smartive-education.github.io/design-system-component-library-lobsome/?path=/story/welcome-hello--page/). 
Throughout the project, we worked collaboratively to achieve a clean, fast and maintainable code. 
By the end of the project, we hope to have gained a deeper understanding of the architecture around [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), 
as well as developed important skills that will serve us well in future academic and professional pursuits.

We look forward to sharing our findings and experiences with our classmates and instructors, 
and to learning from their projects as well. Thanks for checking out our Project!

You can find the deployed and ready to use app here:

### Installing

Step-by-step instructions on how to set up the project.

To use this library you need to add an .npmrc file with an auth-token

```
@smartive-education:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken={auth-token}
```

```
npm install
```
<br>

After successful installation you can use one of the following commands:

```
npm run dev - Runs next dev to start Next.js in development mode
```
```
npm run build - Runs next build to build the application for production usage
```
```
npm run start - Runs next start to start a Next.js production server
```
```
npm run lint - Runs next lint to set up Next.js' built-in ESLint configuration
```

<br>

After successful build and start you should be able to access the app on your browser at: <br> <br>
url: http://localhost:3000

## üõ†Ô∏è Libraries and Tools

### Conventional Commits

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for consistent commit messages.
- The commit message should be structured as follows:

```
<type>[(scope)]: <description>
```

For Example:
```
feat(button): added hover and action styling for button
```

### next-translate
The main goal of [next-translate](https://github.com/aralroca/next-translate) is to keep the translations as simple as possible in a Next.js environment.

Next-translate has two parts: Next.js plugin + i18n API.



### TanStack Query

[TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/overview) (FKA React Query) is often described as the missing data-fetching library for web applications, 
but in more technical terms, it makes fetching, caching, synchronizing and updating server state in 
your web applications a breeze.
